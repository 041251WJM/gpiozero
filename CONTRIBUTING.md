# Contributing

This module was designed for use in education; particularly for young children. It is not intended to replace `RPi.GPIO` and it does not claim to be suitable for all purposes. It is intended to provide a simple interface to everyday components.

If a proposed change added an advanced feature but made basic usage more complex, it is unlikely to be added.
